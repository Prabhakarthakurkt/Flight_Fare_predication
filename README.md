# Flight_Fare_predication
we will be predicating the fare of a flight a person has to give on inputting the data using the noraml machine learning techniques then will we see how can do the same thing with the halp of using Auto SK Learn which is a Auto Ml Library

## Context

we have often heared travelling saying Flight Ticket are often very unpredictable and are very hard to guess. if one might see a price today and price today and checks the same flight price today and checks the same flight price tommorow it's whole different story by then.

Let us create a Machine Learning Model which will help us in predicting the price of a flight on inputting some of the attributes. Here we will be provided with price of flight on inputting some of the atterbutes. Here we will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of april and jun of 2019 and between various cities.

We will do the following things in our Notebooks

   Data Analysis 
   feature Engineering 
   Feature Selection 
   Model Building using ML
   Model Building using Auto SK Learn(Auto ML)


So let's dive in and read our data, but first we will import all the necessary libraries
